# DocuMentor: Your Interactive Digital Tutor

Imagine if any PDF, any document you want to learn, could transform into a customized lesson, perfectly tailored to your level of knowledge and interest. This isn’t just a dream anymore – let us introduce you to **DocuMentor**, your new digital and interactive tutor!

## Overview

**DocuMentor** is an AI-powered tool designed to turn any PDF into an engaging, interactive learning experience. Whether you're a student studying a challenging subject, a professional diving into technical content, or anyone looking to learn something new, **DocuMentor** adapts the material to suit your needs, delivering a custom learning experience like never before.

## How It Works

With **DocuMentor**, users simply upload a PDF they want to study – it could be a scientific article, a technical manual, or even a chapter from a book. From there, the system takes over, using advanced NLP technology called **Llama Parse** to:

- Extract all essential information.
- Break down content into main topics, subtopics, formulas, and image descriptions.

### Personalized Lessons for Every User

Here’s what makes **DocuMentor** truly unique: it doesn’t just read content – it **adapts** it. Based on user data like age, education level, and interests, **DocuMentor** transforms the material into a custom lesson plan:

- Tailored to your depth of understanding.
- Delivered in a format that best suits your learning style.

This means a high school student and a college graduate can both learn from the same content, each at the appropriate level of complexity and detail.

### Engaging Animated Tutor

To make learning even more engaging, **DocuMentor** introduces an animated, realistic avatar, powered by **HeyGen** technology, to teach the content. This avatar acts as your private instructor, explaining concepts, guiding you through the lesson, and making learning come to life.

## Study Materials and Practice

Learning doesn’t stop with just reading and listening. **DocuMentor** goes further by generating practice and study materials for you:

- A PDF with questions, answers, and review problems related to the lesson.
- A personalized study plan to ensure continuous learning and retention.

This way, users leave with a complete learning experience – content that’s been **reviewed**, **practiced**, and **embedded** into their understanding.

## Features

- **Custom Lesson Plans**: Personalized to match your learning level and interests.
- **Animated Avatar Instructor**: Interactive and engaging lessons brought to life by HeyGen technology.
- **Practice Material Generation**: Custom PDF quizzes and review materials.
- **Personalized Study Plan**: Structured learning over time to ensure mastery of the content.

## Why DocuMentor?

- Students mastering tough subjects.
