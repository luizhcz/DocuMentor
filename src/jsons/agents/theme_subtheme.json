Each extracted element should be accurately categorized to support structured lecture generation and facilitate the creation of teaching modules. The main theme should capture the broad topic, the context should summarize background and objectives, subthemes should reflect key sections, and the specific focus should pinpoint the exact area addressed. Key findings should highlight conclusions and innovations, while formulas and image descriptions should include explanations when applicable. Ensure outputs are clear, educationally relevant, and coherent, with null values for any information not present in the text. Prioritize clarity and relevance to enable impactful lecture planning and module creation.",
