Study Schedule (1 Hour Session Daily):** - *First 15 Minutes* - Review class notes focusing on **Photosynthesis Process** stages and **Cellular Respiration** (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, electron transport). - *Next 20 Minutes* - Read biology textbook chapters 6-8, use *Khan Academy* for additional explanations on photosynthesis and respiration. - *Following 15 Minutes* - Complete exercises on chlorophyll, electron transport chains, and enzymes (ATP synthase, rubisco). - *Final 10 Minutes* - Review chloroplast and mitochondria diagrams; self-assess understanding of energy flow. - **2. Study Resources:** - Textbook chapters 6-8, *Khan Academy* videos (search “Photosynthesis,” “Cellular Respiration,” “ATP production”), interactive diagrams, flashcards for chloroplast structures. - **3. Weekly Focus Areas:** - *Week 1* - Photosynthesis Process and chloroplast function, *Week 2* - Cellular Respiration, *Week 3* - Integration of processes and ATP's role. - **4. Exercises and Reinforcement:** - Complete assigned exercises on chloroplast function, glycolysis, ATP production. *Weekend Review* - Summarize and track areas needing improvement. - **5. Progress Tracking:** - Write weekly summaries, review with study partner or teacher. Label blank diagrams of chloroplast and mitochondria. - **6. Additional Recommendations:** - Spend 5-10 mins daily on diagrams, weekly study partner quiz, and online self-quizzes to reinforce topics like the electron transport chain and enzyme functions."
