        "content": "**Study Plan:**\n\n- **1. Study Schedule (1 Hour Session Daily):**\n  - **First 15 Minutes**: Review class notes focusing on **Photosynthesis Process** stages and **Cellular Respiration** (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, electron transport).\n  - **Next 20 Minutes**: Read biology textbook chapters 6-8, use *Khan Academy* for additional explanations on photosynthesis and respiration.\n  - **Following 15 Minutes**: Complete exercises on chlorophyll, electron transport chains, and enzymes (ATP synthase, rubisco).\n  - **Final 10 Minutes**: Review chloroplast and mitochondria diagrams; self-assess understanding of energy flow.\n\n- **2. Study Resources:**\n  - Textbook chapters 6-8, *Khan Academy* videos (search “Photosynthesis,” “Cellular Respiration,” “ATP production”), interactive diagrams, flashcards for chloroplast structures.\n\n- **3. Weekly Focus Areas:**\n  - **Week 1**: Photosynthesis Process and chloroplast function\n  - **Week 2**: Cellular Respiration\n  - **Week 3**: Integration of processes and ATP's role\n\n- **4. Exercises and Reinforcement:**\n  - Complete assigned exercises on chloroplast function, glycolysis, ATP production.\n  - *Weekend Review*: Summarize and track areas needing improvement.\n\n- **5. Progress Tracking:**\n  - Write weekly summaries, review with study partner or teacher. Label blank diagrams of chloroplast and mitochondria.\n\n- **6. Additional Recommendations:**\n  - Spend 5-10 mins daily on diagrams, weekly study partner quiz, and online self-quizzes to reinforce topics like the electron transport chain and enzyme functions."
